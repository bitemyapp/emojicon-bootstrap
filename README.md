# Emojicon Bootstrap!

First, if you have Mac OS X, get dash expander
http://lifehacker.com/5839461/dashexpander-is-an-amazing-free-text-expansion-tool-for-mac-os-x
Next, after it's installed, copy my database over yours (before you've
added data)

    cp ./library.dash ~/Library/Application\ Support/DashExpander/library.dash

Fire dash expander up and enjoy the initial emojicons to work with,
you can table-flip with EASE!
