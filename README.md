# Emojicon Bootstrap!

First, if you have Mac OS X, get dash expander

Next, after it's installed, copy my database over yours (before you've
added data)

    cp ./library.dash ~/Library/Application\ Support/DashExpander/library.dash

Fire dash expander up and enjoy the initial emojicons to work with,
you can table-flip with EASE!

Other operating systems? Look at dump_e.txt and the code I used to
scrape the originating collection to reuse the curated emojicons.
